Task 1
Assume you have an array of k SORTED linked lists.
What is the time and space complexity to use MinHeap to merge these k SORTED linked lists? Note that for this question you only need to give the time complexity of merging using a min-heap. You assume the given linked lists are already sorted. Do not include in your answer the time to sort a liked list.
Assume the TOTAL number of nodes in all the lists is N (that is N is the sum of the number of nodes in each list). In the example given for Task 3, N is 16 (5nodes + 3nodes + 7nodes + 1node).  

Time complexity(N,k): O(Nlog(k))

Since the array of linked lists is part of the input data (that is how the lists are provided), you should NOT count the array itself in the space complexity.
Space complexity(N,k): O(k)
